# Obelisk

Welcome to **Obelisk**, an open-source project dedicated to providing a powerful management system for data-driven applications. **Obelisk** serves as the core backend infrastructure, enabling dynamic data management and integration with UI components to build scalable, modular web solutions.

> **Note:** This repository is in its conceptual phase and does not yet contain any code. Contributions and community insights are highly encouraged to shape the project.

## Project Inspiration

The concept for **Obelisk** emerged from the vision of creating a centralized system to seamlessly manage and integrate data for dynamic, component-based UIs. Inspired by existing CMS frameworks and dynamic web applications, Obelisk is designed to act as a **headless backend**, focusing on handling the logic and data requirements of web components built with tools like **E.Co**.

The project draws inspiration from popular headless CMS systems, backend frameworks, and modular management tools. **Obelisk** aims to offer a more integrated approach for managing dynamic data and UI components together.

## Vision

**Obelisk** aims to provide:

- **Centralized data management** for component-based systems.
- **Dynamic integrations** with UI tools like **E.Co** for flexible rendering and interaction.
- **Data modeling and management** capabilities with a scalable and intuitive interface.
- **Headless infrastructure** for web applications, empowering developers to manage content and logic separately from the presentation layer.

## Current Status

This project is currently in its **conceptual design stage**. We are focusing on architectural planning and gathering feedback to create a clear development roadmap.

## Contribution

We encourage contributions from developers, architects, and enthusiasts interested in building a modern backend management system. Join us in shaping **Obelisk** to support dynamic, data-driven applications!
